## CHARACTERS THAT HAVENT NEEDED CHANGES

Keep in mind this list is from very quick tests per character and may not be comprehensive to things such as late hits and some special moves. 48 expression scripts already exist in hdr, idk how many im adding so i might update this but i guess some stuff is already covered.

- Mario
- Kirby
- Dr Mario
- Meta Knight
- Samus(?) this is dubious i feel like shes playable with rumble but up smash and forward air may appreciate some tuning down the line
