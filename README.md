## CHARACTERS THAT HAVENT NEEDED CHANGES

Keep in mind this list is from very quick tests per character and may not be comprehensive to things such as late hits and some special moves. 48 expression scripts already exist in hdr, idk how many im adding so i might update this but i guess some stuff is already covered.

- Mario
- Kirby
- Dr Mario
- Meta Knight
- Samus(?) this is dubious i feel like shes playable with rumble but up smash and forward air may appreciate some tuning down the line
- Snake (this was a surprise to me but his rumble works perfect lol)

## COULDNT FIX

Mainly throws, I'm probably missing something but ive left the expression code there as it at least fixes screenshake time and itll make it easier for whoever wants to change it themselves

- Jigglypuff
  - Back throw

- Greninja
  - F throw

- Ness
  - I was unable to fix up smash (is this a vanilla fix? im not sure, it just felt inconsistent despite not having hdr changes) ?
